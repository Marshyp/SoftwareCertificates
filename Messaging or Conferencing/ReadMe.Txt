Most of this is Org discretion really

I would advise for PWAs (progressive web app) over hard clients wherever possible due to lower permission level

Discord can house some nasty malware - the application usage itself isn't usually the problem (Sure electron has its problems) but its due to how the hosting works, very easy to get free hosting of malware via discord's CDN

Telegram is another one I'd cautious about due to the large amount of piracy/hacker groups spreading files via this platform
