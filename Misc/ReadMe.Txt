Nothing Overly Suspicious in this category, however some points:

OBS can be used for data leakage via screen-capture, take note of who is allowed to use screen recording software
IDA can be an issue if used on corporate Software
Apache Cert is used on OpenOffice which can be unexpected
BlueStacks can be pesky if android malware is loaded in the emulator
ClipClip could be a data concern
WinZip is unecessary compared to 7zip and creates an annoying scheduled task also - 7zip is free and much lighterweight, the only drawback is not having zone propogration by default which means MOTW flag is dropped, see Post:https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/7-zip-now-supports-windows-mark-of-the-web-security-feature/
Winauth is windows 2fa application which may catch out lazy admins not using seperate device for MFA  
WinRar is garbage compared to 7zip, thank you and goodbye
