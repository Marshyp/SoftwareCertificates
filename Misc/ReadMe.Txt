Nothing Overly Suspicious in this category, however some points:

OBS can be used for data leakage via screen
IDA can be an issue if used on corporate Software
WinZip is unecessary compared to 7zip and creates an annoying scheduled task also - 7zip is free and much lighterweight, the only drawback is not having zone propogration by default which means MOTW flag is dropped, see Post:https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/7-zip-now-supports-windows-mark-of-the-web-security-feature/
